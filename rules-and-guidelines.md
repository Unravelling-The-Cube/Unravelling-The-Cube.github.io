A list of the rules and guidelines for participating in UTC Competitions!
## Basic Guidelines (StackMat or Timer)
During the competition, you are expected to follow WCA Competition rules as accurately as possible. If you have a StackMat timer, we ask you to use it if possible. If not, don't worry! It is not required to compete! Just make sure your timer can measure to the hundredths place (XX:XX.XX).

## Format
The Format of this competition is Ao5. You will have to do 5 solves with the same scrambles as provided in the #week-x-scrambles channel. Your fastest and slowest time will be ignored, and the mean of the remaining three solves will be calculated. For example, 16.20, 16.58, (18.96) 15.79 (15.35) ao5 = 16.19.
### NOTE - You don't have to calculate your ao5, as our software will do it for you!

## Entering Times
In the scrambles channel, you will see five scrambles for each event. If you don't know how to read the scramble notation, please don't hesitate to ask, as our team will be able to provide you with a tutorial! You will have to scramble your own puzzle according to the scramble provided in the form. After timing your solve with the designated scramble, you can enter each of your times in the respective section using the Discord Bot's commands!
You can only participate once per competition, so double entries will be removed.

## Disqualifications
The following can lead to the disqualification of a participant:
- Cheating
- No submissions of Video Evidence
- If the video submitted by the winner is not clear
- If the video submitted by the participant has done wrong scramble/has any signs of cheating.
